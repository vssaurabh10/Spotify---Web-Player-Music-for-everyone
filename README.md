# Spotify - Web Player : Music for everyone
This is a fully responsive Spotify-themed music player built using only HTML and CSS. The project replicates the basic layout and design of the Spotify music player, featuring a sleek user interface with controls like play, pause, next, and previous buttons. Although it doesn't include JavaScript functionality for actual audio playback, the design elements closely resemble the original Spotify web player.
