# Spotify---Web-Player-Music-for-everyone
This is a fully responsive Spotify-themed music player built using only HTML and CSS. The project replicates the basic layout and design of the Spotify music player, featuring a sleek user interface with controls like play, pause, next, and previous buttons. Although it doesn't include JavaScript functionality for actual audio playback.
